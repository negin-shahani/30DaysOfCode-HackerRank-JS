# 30DaysOfCode of HackerRank -Javascript :computer:
My Java Scripts solutions for the 30 Days Of Code challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code).
## Day 0 - Hello, World.
**Input Format:** _A single line of text denoting  (the variable whose contents must be printed)._

**Output Format:** _Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of  on the second line._

**Sample Input**
```
  Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
```

**Sample Output**
```
  Hello, World. 
  Welcome to 30 Days of Code!
```
## Day 1 - Data Types
**Task:** _The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:_

1. Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
3. Use the  operator to perform the following operations:
   - Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
   - Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
   - Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

**Input Format:** 
- The first line contains an integer that you must sum with .
- The second line contains a double that you must sum with .
- The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with .

**Output Format:** _Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to  decimal place) on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line._

**Sample Input**

## Day 2 - Operators
**Task:** _Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer._

**Input Format:** 
  There are  lines of numeric input:
    1. The first line has a double, meal_cost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
    2. The second line has an integer, tip_percent (the percentage of meal_cost being added as tip).
    3. The third line has an integer, tax_percent (the percentage of meal_cost being added as tax).

**Output Format:** _print the meal's total cost._

**Sample Input**
```
